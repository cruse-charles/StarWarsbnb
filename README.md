# Welcome to StarWarsbnb

## Introduction

StarWarsbnb is a clone of the Airbnb desktop website. Airbnb is a website which allows users to select from a listing of homes to rent for a selected amount of time. A use can create a reservation for a listing, write a rewview, create wishlists, search/filter through listings, and use a map to see listing locations. The sleek and fairly complex logic to create the website led me to to undergo creating this clone. Technologies implemented:
* Languages: Javascript, Ruby, HTML, CSS
* Frontend: React-Redux
* Database: PostgreSQL
* hosting: Render.com
* Asset Storage: AWS Simple Cloud Storage (S3)

## MVPs

### Reservations

A user will be able to create a reservation from the calendar set on the listing's show page. This calendar will have functionality that prevents a user from creating a reservation for a listing that has overlapping dates with another reservation from the same or a different user. Users will be allowed to edit or delete their reservation as well.


### Reviews

A user will be able to create a review for a listing on the listing's show page. The review will be added to the page without having to refresh the page. User's will not be able to edit/remove the reviews of other users. When deleting a review, it will also be deleted without having to refresh the page.






StarWarsbnb was created within a 14 day timeframe. Thank you for checking out my project!
